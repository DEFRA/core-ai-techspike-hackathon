Subject: Farming subsidies (Case Ref: RM35299)
 
Good afternoon,
 
I hope you are well. Rachel has been contacted by a constituent regarding farming subsidies.
 
Rachel’s constituent has reported:
 
‘My family farm arable and livestock in Hanbury. The Rural Payments agency  payments are declining ending in 2027. I am aware that there will be a Sustainable Farming Incentive to help improve the environment but that will not replace the Basic Payment amount which subsidies the production of reasonably priced healthy food for everyone. I am worried how farmers will be able to cope with such a big change and loss of support. I feel that farmers are getting left behind.
 
              We are also growing some flowering grass to help support nature, as part of our Stewardship scheme, which we cut but can’t make it into an animal feed. It is just left to enhance the quality of the soil. I am interested to know why the government doesn’t grow this grass on grass verges and on motorway embankments, which doesn’t have a purpose and let farmers produce more food which is desperately needed. I look forward to hearing your ideas on these valuable subjects.’
 
Could we please ask for the department’s comments on the above?
 
Your assistance in this matter would be very much appreciated.
 
Many thanks,
Rory
