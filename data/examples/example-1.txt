Subject: Farming

Dear Edward
�
I write to express my exasperation at the current state of farming in the UK. I meant to follow up after our meeting with you and other farmers several months ago, but have been preoccupied with life on the farm.
�
We are an organic beef and sheep enterprise and in spite of incredible hard work and meticulous number crunching are unable to make our livestock operation pay for itself. We will shortly be losing our Basic Payment as you know and thereafter it will be costing us to farm! We felt reassured that after Brexit there would be a replacement system put in place but it never happened. There are several schemes available but even if we sign up for everything available to us, all of which incurs extra work and admin, we can only claw back a fraction of what we will be losing. It seems that most of the money available is encouraging us NOT to farm (planting woodland or leaving farming altogether). I simply cannot understand why the government is not prioritising food production and why food security is not at the top of its agenda.
�
I discovered to my dismay that payments for organic farming (management grant OT1 through Countryside Stewardship Mid Tier) will not be increasing. Why is this? This seems to be penalising those who have already converted to organic farming because the conversion payments for organic have increased. As organic farmers we are doing everything according to the sustainable goals the Government purports to promote, but we are not being recognised for it. An increase in this payment could make our farm viable and encourage others to go down the organic route and to continue along it, which surely has to be a good thing. The organic management payment would be a great way to replace the BPS for all, giving us a reasonable back up while we do the right thing.
�
The other route we have to make a difference is the Educational Access Grant (also part of our Mid Tier Countryside Stewardship). This suits us well because we are in a position to offer access to schools and colleges and it chimes well with the Government's "public money for public goods". However there is currently a cap of 25 visits per year. Why is this?
�
If something radical is not put in place many farmers will be going out of business in the very near future. They will not be replaced. Where on earth is our food going to come from? I sincerely hope the plan is not to grow our food in factories. It seems that is the way we are going.
�
With kind regards
�
Jane Smith
