Dear Thérèse, 
I am writing regarding the impact of the Environmental Land Management Scheme (ELMS) on uplands farmers. The Lake District and Yorkshire Dales include some of the most important uplands in Europe in terms of heritage, landscape, species diversity, and carbon capture. 
Cumbria has a farmed area of 508,000 hectares, which equates to around 5.6 percent of the total farmland in England. Upland areas are categorised by the Government as Less Favoured Areas and, despite their beauty and importance, are being overlooked and undervalued. Uplands farmers are being pushed to the brink of their economic margins. 
Payments for farming reflect this, having been cut by at least 35 percent from pre-Brexit levels, with uplands farmers being the hardest hit. DEFRA has shown a 65 percent reduction in Uplands Farm Business Income, which is likely to fall as low as £16,300 in 2022/23. 
Uplands farmers currently receive Government payments of a mere £98 per hectare, whilst their lowlands counterparts receive £151 per hectare. Farmers want to take part in ELMS. They agree wholeheartedly with the principle of public money for public goods. But the public money is so desperately low that they can’t afford to sign up to the new schemes, and we risk losing our army of environmental stewards as a result. 
Farmers should not be economically disadvantaged simply due to their geographical location. If the Government is serious about preserving our biodiversity and climate, it must uprate ELMS payments for uplands farmers in line with the lowland equivalents. 
This will provide incentive to create nature-friendly. farming practices as well as help those who our country relies so much on. I look forward to hearing your view on this matter and would welcome a meeting at your convenience. 
Yours Sincerely, 
Tim Farron MP
